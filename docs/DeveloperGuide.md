## 1. Setting up

## 2. Design

### 2.1. Architecture

### 2.2. UI component

### 2.3. Module parsing logic component
**Structure of the module logic component.**
<br>
The module parsing logic of our application consists of 4 classes: ```TimetableParser ModuleApiParser ModuleHandler LessonsGenerator```.
A detailed implementation would be explained in the implementation section.
<br>
 API: ```modulelogic.LessonsGenerator```
<br>
1. ```LessonsGenerator``` uses the ```TimetableParser``` class to acquire the modules a user is taking, including the timeslots of those modules.
2. ```LessonsGenerator``` also uses ```Modulehandler``` to retrieve a set of information related to a specific module.
3. With both information, ```LessonsGenerator``` is able to dynamically generate the user's time-slots stored in ```ArrayList<String[]>``` via a series of Key-Value pair hashing.
4. ```Arraylist<String[]> ``` contains the start/end time, days and weeks of all modules the user is taking.
<br>

### 2.4. Member component

### 2.5. Meeting component
The Meeting component of our application consists of 2 classes: ```Meeting MeetingList```
<br>

### 2.6. Exception classes

### 2.7. Common classes


## 3. Implementation
This section describes some noteworthy details of how our application works in the backend.
### 3.1. Detailed implementation of modulelogic component
![modulelogic Component](images/TimetableParser.png)<br>
The above figure shows```TimetableParser```, a private class called exclusively by ```LessonsGenerator```. It makes use of regex to sift through timetable link provided by user in the form of ```String``` object and stores
the semester and the user's module information according to the timetable link provided. It depends on the ```common.Messages``` class to provide the exception message when an incorrect link is being parsed.
![modulelogic Component](images/ModuleHandler.jpg)<br>
 From the figure above, ```ModuleApiParser``` instantiates a HTTP GET request object to fetch a Json object from the open-sourced NUSMOD API server, and is called by ```ModuleHandler``` every time a particular module information is requested.
 <br>
```ModuleHandler``` cleans the data provided by ```ModuleApiParser``` and stores an easy to use data structure to be used by ```LessonsGenerator```.
![modulelogic Component](images/LessonsGenerator.jpg)<br>
 Finally, ```LessonsGenerator``` collates the returned data structure from both ```ModuleHandler```(looped for as many modules the user takes) and ```TimetableParser```, calling```.lessonsChecker()``` simultaneously to create a set of information containing the start-time, end-time, day, weeks of the modules that a user is taking.
 <br>
 The information from ```LessonsGenerator``` would then be included in the schedule of a particular ```TeamMember```.
### 3.2. Design Considerations
#### 3.2.1. Aspect: Fetching of module information
* Alternative 1(current choice): Instantiate a ```ModuleHandler``` every time there's a request for a module information.
Pros: The classes are intuitively separated and data structures returned is understandable.
Cons: Program runs slower for every extra timetable or extra modules taken since its a new instantiation of a ```ModuleHandler```.
* Alternative 2: Instantiate ```ModuleHandler``` once for every user. 
Pros: Takes up less memory and setup time for every timetable provided compared to alternative 1.
Cons: The data structure returned by ```ModuleHandler``` would be complicated and confusing for new developers.

## Appendix G: Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

> :information_source: These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.
